# prob-process-tree

Implementation of Probabilistic Process Trees as found in "Burke, Leemans, and Wynn (2021) - Discovering Stochastic Process Models By Reduction and Abstraction" ([summary](https://adamburkeware.net/2021/08/02/toothpaste.html) and [paper](https://adamburkeware.net/papers/burke_leemans_wynn_discovering_toothpaste_20210322.pdf)).

This library minimizes dependencies to facilitate reuse. This includes minimizing ProM dependencies. For functions which convert to ProM Petri net classes, see examples in the [spm_dim project](https://github.com/adamburkegh/spm_dim).
