# prob-process-tree

Implementation of Probabilistic Process Trees as found in "Burke, Leemans, and Wynn (2021) - Discovering Stochastic Process Models By Reduction and Abstraction"

This library minimizes dependencies to facilitate reuse. This includes minimizing ProM dependencies. For functions which convert to ProM Petri net classes, see examples in the [spm_dim project](https://github.com/adamburkegh/spm_dim).
